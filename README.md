# PleromaWebClient
A simple WebClient for Pleroma instances that supports desktop notifications!

## Working
Since it is a web client I am simply adding desktop notifications essentially to the web UI.

- Flashing window when new notifications come in
- Desktop Notifications (Popups, taskbar bubble, Windows 10 Notification, etc)

## Not Working

- Saving Password for automatic login


## To-do

TBD
